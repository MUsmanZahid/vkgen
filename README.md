# vkgen
vkgen is an offline Vulkan XML specification to Rust code generator. It aims to be robust and generate semantic Rust code that follows the community's code-style guidelines.

# Usage
The binary takes a single argument, the path to the Vulkan registry (the XML specification). If no arguments are provided, it looks for the registry file in the current working directory.

If running the binary
```bash
./vkgen [PATH-TO-vk.xml]
```
or with cargo
```bash
cargo run --release -- [PATH-TO-vk.xml]
```

The generated Rust code will be available in a folder called `vk`. This will include the autogenerated structures, enumerations, constants, and handles defined in the Vulkan specification as well as a meta-loader to load Vulkan functions from the GPU.

# Dependencies
vkgen aims to minimise dependencies and thus reduce build time.
